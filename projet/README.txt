This project has been created by Victor Doucet and Jérémy Duval.

It is base on http://www.netlogoweb.org/launch#http://www.netlogoweb.org/assets/modelslib/Sample%20Models/Biology/Ants.nlogo

The goal is to observe ths conflicts between anthills.

The simulation is a big simplification of the reality, particulary because of the lack of time.

The ants behaviors are principaly base on http://www.laguerredesfourmis.com/
